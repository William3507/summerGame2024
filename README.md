# summerGame2024
 
A game to work on during the summer of 2024. I hope to do 30-60 minutes of work per day. Each Commit should describe what is being added. 


# Day One - The Basics
### 30 minutes
Set up basic player movement, and added a standin enemy.

# Day Two - Projectiles, Enemies, Walls oh my
### 1 hour
Set up projectile firing from the player. I also added walls that summon bars to mimic movement along a road of some kind. I was also able to improve the stand-in enemy. It now has health that depletes when hit by projectiles from the player. The projectiles dissapear when they hit an enemy, and the enemy is destroyed when it loses all of its health. 

# Day Three - Powerups!
### 30 minutes
Changed the projectiles to fire automatically. This allows for easier access, and better suited powerups that apply more evenly across the board. The enemy no longer spins when hit with a projectile. Added a powerup template that can be modified depending on the powerup wanted. The current stand in one (and the only one actually coded) doubles the players fire speed. 

##### Plans for tomorrow:
* Powerup movements (down screen)
* Different types of powerups
* Enemy movement
